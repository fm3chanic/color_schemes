## fm3chanic Color Schemes

This repo is a collection of HTML files containing color schemes for text editors / terminal applications made by me. The HTML files work as visual reference sheets as well as data source to automatically built themes based on a template. Therefore format and base information is fix.<br>
Color schemes which have been created during my project of color theming Vtubers will be in the directory called "vtuber_project". Color schemes which were created outside this project will be in the directory "other".
