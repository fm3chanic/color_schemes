## fm3chanic color theme galery

This galery contains all my color themes which are not related to my vtuber project. All of these color themes were built during my freetime and served as an outlet for my creativity.<br>
Please check the galery of the [project repository](https://github.com/fm3chanic/vtuber_project) for their pictures.

**Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas**<br>
This theme was inspired by this literary masterpiece by Jules Verne. My goal was creating the feel of being underwater yet with a touch of Steampunk style in it.<br>
